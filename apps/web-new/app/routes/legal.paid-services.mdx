# {frontmatter.title}

This document contains the Supplemental Terms and agreement applicable to our Services if you should choose to subscribe to them.

Subscribing to our Services implies you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or revise these Terms at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any such change or modification will be effective immediately upon posting, and your continued use of the Service after any changes or modifications to these Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to, such changes or modifications. If you object to any change or modification, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Service.

### Eligibility

By subscribing to our Services, you affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, and to abide by and comply with these Terms.

### Fees and Payments

You agree to pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. By providing us with your payment information, you agree that we are authorized to immediately invoice your account for all fees and charges due and payable to us as a result of your subscription to our Services. You agree to immediately notify us of any change in your payment information. We reserve the right at any time to change our prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on our website or by e-mail delivery to you.

### Price Changes

We reserve the right to change the price of our Services at any time. We will notify you of any price changes by posting a notice on our website. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next billing period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price.

### Automatic Renewal

Unless you notify us before the end of the applicable subscription period that you no longer wish to receive the Service, your subscription will automatically renew, and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Service (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time.

### Refunds

Upon remittance of payment and activation of the Service, you will not be entitled to any refund or exchange for any reason whatsoever, even if the Service is suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Service term.

We reserve the right to offer refunds, discounts, or other consideration in select circumstances at our sole discretion. Please note that each circumstance is unique and election to make such an offer in one instance does not create the obligation to do so in another.

### Cancellation

When you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.

You agree that we may suspend or terminate your subscription and/or access to the Service for any reason at any time without notice. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### Lifetime Subscriptions

Lifetime subscriptions are offered as a one-time payment for the lifetime of the Service. Lifetime subscriptions are not transferrable, and are only valid for the Service they were purchased for. Lifetime subscriptions are not valid for any other Service, and cannot be transferred to any other Service.

For the purposes of plan provisioning, the lifetime of the Service is defined as the lifetime of the Service as offered by us. If the Service is discontinued, the lifetime of the Service is defined as the lifetime of the Service as offered by us, or the lifetime of the Service as offered by us prior to discontinuation, whichever is shorter.

### Termination

We reserve the right to terminate your access to the Service, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services. If you terminate these Terms, you will not be entitled to any refund or exchange for any reason whatsoever, even if the Service is suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Service term.
