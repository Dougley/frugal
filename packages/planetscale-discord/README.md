# Planetscale

This is a [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com) integration specifically for Frugal's Discord interactions.

While this package is technically generic, it depends on some Frugal-specific code, specifically some of the variables defined at build time. If you want to use this package for your own project, you'll need to change the build variables to match your own project.
